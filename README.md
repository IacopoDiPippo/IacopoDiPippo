- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @IacopoDiPippo
Master's Student in Mathematics in Data Science | TUM

I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Data Science at the Technical University of Munich (TUM), where I am deepening my knowledge in data analysis, machine learning, and statistical modeling. My academic background includes a Bachelor's degree in Theoretical Mathematics, which has equipped me with strong analytical and problem-solving skills.

Passionate about translating complex data into actionable insights, I am now eager to apply my theoretical expertise in a practical, real-world context. I am particularly interested in opportunities that allow me to leverage my mathematical skills to tackle challenging problems in the industry.

Outside of academia, I have played competitive volleyball in Italy for three years, reaching Serie D. This experience has not only taught me the importance of teamwork and communication but also instilled a sense of discipline and perseverance, qualities that I believe are essential in both professional and personal growth.
